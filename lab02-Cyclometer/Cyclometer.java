//This program acts as a bicycle cyclometer (meant to measure speed, distance, etc.)
//It records two kinds of data, the time elapsed in seconds, and the number of rotations
//of the front wheel during that time. 
//For two trips, given time and rotation count
//The program will output each trip in miles, as well as the total trip in miles
